# Delicious Chicken Wing Dessert

A 'confusingly-good' sweet and savory chicken wing recipe that commits to flavor. This is the `main` branch of dessert wings.

> **Note:** This recipe leans heavily into sweet and sticky, treating the wing as a canvas for a dessert-like glaze.

## Instructions

1.  **Prep Wings:**
    * Preheat oven to `400°F` (or `200°C`).
    * Pat the chicken wings completely dry with paper towels. This is key for a crispy `build`.
    * In a large bowl, `git add` the flour, paprika, garlic powder, salt, and pepper. Whisk to combine.
    * Add the wings to the bowl and toss until fully coated.

2.  **Cook Wings:**
    * Arrange wings in a single layer on a wire rack set over a baking sheet.
    * Bake for 45-50 minutes, flipping halfway through, until golden brown and crispy.
    * (Alternatively: Air fry at `380°F` for 20-25 minutes, shaking the basket halfway).

3.  **Make the Glaze:**
    * While wings are cooking, `git init` the glaze.
    * In a small saucepan, combine all glaze ingredients *except* the cornstarch slurry.
    * Bring to a simmer over medium heat.
    * Once simmering, whisk in the cornstarch slurry.
    * Stir constantly for 1-2 minutes until the glaze thickens enough to coat the back of a spoon. Remove from heat.

4.  **Combine and 'Commit':**
    * Place the cooked, crispy wings in a large, clean bowl.
    * Pour the warm glaze all over the wings.
    * Toss gently until every wing is fully coated and glossy.

## Serving

* `git push` the wings onto a serving platter.
* Garnish immediately with the toasted sesame seeds, crushed candied nuts, and sliced green onions.
* Serve hot, perhaps with a "frosting" dip made of Greek yogurt, honey, and lime zest.
